##Inspiration
When the infamous Edward Snowden came out and revealed that the NSA was tracking and collecting private user data, he was driven out of his country and was deemed by the government as a criminal. In more recent times, we have seen how elections are being interfered by external sources such as russian hackers. These deeply rooted political issues was something our team felt had to be addressed.

##What it does
We built a platform for whistleblowers to safely report mishaps in governmental and corporate hierarchies without feeling scared that they will be tracked. This information will then be available to masses of people as it rightfully should be.

##How we built it
The platform is built using the languages Python3, HTML5 and CSS. Face-ID verification was implemented using the modules opencv and face recognition in collaboration with Flask. The blockchain SHA-256 encryption for the user information was developed in Python3, with Flask and Google Drive API to store the blockchain on a google sheet. The landing page where the whistleblower reports are posted was connected to a backend of sqlite3. The website front-end was created with HTML5 and CSS.

##Challenges we ran into
Being high schoolers, we were new to hackathons and working in teams for coding projects. Especially this hackathon being a virtual one, made it much more challenging (yet fun!). We ran into issues with establishing a sqlite3 database, connecting servers, and using opencv to do face recognition.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating our first ever blockchain
- Integrating face recognition to our platform

##What we learned
- We learned to work with Google Drive API to store data
- How to run a Flask Server
- The intricacies of blockchain

##What's next for Loud Whistle
- Making it more user-friendly
- Upvote and Downvote system for posts
- Multilingual platform
